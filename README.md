# Courser
Courser is a course recommendation and registration system that models courses as a graph, suggesting optimal learning paths based on prerequisites and credits. It features user authentication, course exploration, and a leaderboard (max heap) tracking top users by accumulated credits while preventing scheduling conflicts.
